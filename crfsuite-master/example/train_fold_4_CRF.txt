O	,
O	higher

O	the

O	of
B-drug	tubocurarine
O	and
O	may

O	.

O	The
O	concomitant
O	use
O	of
B-drug	diflunisal
O	tablets
O	and

O	is
O	not

O	,
O	with

O	Patients

O	The

O	can
O	be

O	CASE
O	SUMMARY
O	:
O	A
O	64-year-old
O	African-American
O	man
O	was
O	admitted
O	to
O	the
O	hospital
O	for
O	worsening
O	renal
O	failure
O	,
O	elevated
O	creatine
O	phosphokinase
O	,
O	diffuse
O	muscle
O	pain
O	,
O	and
O	severe
O	muscle
O	weakness
O	.

B-drug	Allopurinol
O	:
O	Increased
O	possibility
O	of
O	skin
O	rash
O	,
O	particularly
O	in
O	hyperuricemic
O	patients
O	may
O	occur
O	.

O	Effects
O	of
B-group	xanthine
I-group	derivatives
O	in
O	a
O	light/dark
O	test
O	in
O	mice
O	and
O	the
O	contribution
O	of
O	adenosine
O	receptors
O	.

O	Therefore
O	,
O	patients
O	on
B-drug	propranolol
O	should
O	be
O	observed
O	when
B-brand	COLESTID
O	Tablets
O	are
O	either
O	added
O	or
O	deleted
O	from
O	a
O	therapeutic
O	regimen
O	.

B-group	Phenothiazines
O	and
B-group	butyrophenones
O	may
O	reduce
O	or
O	reverse
O	the
O	pressor
O	effect
O	of
B-drug	epinephrine
O	.

O	There
O	were
O	no
O	reports
O	of
O	skeletal
O	myopathy
O	in
O	a
O	placebo-controlled
O	Phase
O	I
O	trial
O	in
O	which
O	10
O	healthy
O	subjects
O	on
O	stable
B-drug	simvastatin
O	therapy
O	were
O	treated
O	concurrently
O	with
B-drug	daptomycin
O	(
O	4
O	mg/kg
O	once
O	every
O	24
O	hours
O	)
O	for
O	14
O	days
O	.

O	METHODS
O	:
O	We
O	carried
O	out
O	two
O	different
O	3-way
O	crossover
O	studies
O	in
O	healthy
O	subjects
O	(
O	each
O	,
O	n
O	=
O	9
O	)
O	.

O	In
O	addition
O	,
O	under
O	the
O	influence
O	of
O	sympatholytic
O	medicinal
O	products
O	such
O	as
B-group	beta-blockers
O	,
B-drug	clonidine
O	,
B-drug	guanethidine
O	,
O	and
B-drug	reserpine
O	,
O	the
O	signs
O	of
O	hypoglycemia
O	may
O	be
O	reduced
O	or
O	absent
O	.

O	Since
B-group	barbiturates
O	are
O	potentiated
O	by
O	the
B-group	anticholinesterases
O	,
O	they
O	should
O	be
O	used
O	cautiously
O	in
O	the
O	treatment
O	of
O	convulsions
O	.

O	Patients
O	receiving
O	medications
O	that
O	interfere
O	with
O	platelet
O	function
O	or
O	coagulation
O	should
O	have
O	more
O	frequent
O	laboratory
O	monitoring
O	for
O	thrombocytopenia
O	.

O	Pre-treatment
O	with
O	the
O	CYP3A4
O	inducer
B-drug	rifampicin
O	decreased
B-drug	erlotinib
O	AUC
O	by
O	about
O	2/3
O	.

O	These
O	doses
O	are
O	lower
O	than
O	the
O	therapeutic
O	doses
O	for
O	both
O	drugs
O	.

O	Should
O	not
O	be
O	used
O	as

B-brand	SUSTIVA
O	.

O	In

O	studies
O	:
O	Studies
O	in

O	,
O	and
O	to

O	by
O	CYP2C9
O	.

O	Careful
O	observation
O	is
O	required
O	when
B-drug	amantadine
O	is
O	administered
O	concurrently
O	with
B-group	central
I-group	nervous
I-group	system
I-group	stimulants
O	.

B-brand	Accutane
O	use
O	is
O	associated
O	with

O	in
O	some

O	.

B-group	Antiretroviral

O	If

O	The

O	in

O	with
O	CNS-active
O	drugs
O	has
O	not

O	.

O	In

O	These

O	when

O	Patients

O	narrow
O	therapeutic
O	ratio
O	drugs
O	or
O	other
O	drugs
O	that
O	require
O	careful
O	titration

O	Evidence
O	supporting
O	the
O	conclusion
O	that
O	it
O	is
O	inadvisable
O	to
O	co-administer
B-drug	fluvoxamine
O	and
B-drug	diazepam
O	is
O	derived
O	from
O	a
O	study
O	in
O	which
O	healthy
O	volunteers
O	taking
O	150
O	mg/day
O	of
B-drug	fluvoxamine
O	were
O	administered
O	a
O	single
O	oral
O	dose
O	of
O	10
O	mg
O	of
B-drug	diazepam
O	.

O	Inhibition
O	of
O	these
O	isoenzymes
O	may
O	increase
O	the
O	plasma
O	concentration
O	of
B-drug	bosentan
O	.

O	These
O	results
O	are
O	consistent
O	with
O	the
O	in

O	finding
O	that
O	neither
B-drug	isotretinoin
O	nor

O	metabolites
O	induce

O	the
O	activity
O	of
O	the
O	CYP
O	2C9
O	human
O	hepatic
O	P450
O	enzyme
O	.

O	Although

O	studies
O	have
O	not
O	been
O	conducted
O	,
O	in
O	vitro
O	studies
O	of

O	indicate
O	that
O	no

O	inhibition
O	of
O	cytochrome
O	P450
O	drug
O	metabolism
O	would
O	be
O	expected
O	.

O	least
O	2
O	hours
O	after
O	or
O	6
O	hours
O	before
O	dosing
O	with
B-drug	ciprofloxacin
O	because

B-drug	aluminum
O	.

B-group	Thyroid
O	administration
O	to
O	a
O	digitalized
O	,
O	hypothyroid
O	patient
O	may
O	increase
O	the
O	dose
O	requirement
O	of
B-drug	digoxin
O	.

O	Similarly
O	,
B-drug	diazepam
O	decreased
O	the

O	(

O	.

O	The

O	symptoms
O	.

O	Therefore
O	,
O	positive
O	test
O	results

O	therapy
O	,
O	discontinuation
O	of

O	and
O	compromise
O	their
O	therapeutic
O	effects
O	.

B-drug	Insulin

O	in

O	may
O	be
O	increased

B-group	Gold

O	The

O	,
B-drug	famciclovir

I-drug	disoproxil
I-drug	fumarate
O	.

O	therefore
O	,
O	administration

O	As

B-drug	triamterene

O	and
B-drug	folic
I-drug	acid
O	.

B-drug	Digoxin
O	:
O	Some
B-group	calcium
I-group	blockers
O	may
O	increase
O	the

O	in

O	.

O	The
O	mechanism

B-drug_n	PTX
O	was

O	Pregnancy
B-group	estrogens

O	Reformed

O	Free

O	.

O	Exposed

I-drug_n	A

O	for
B-drug_n	toxin
I-drug_n	A
O	using
B-drug	zinc-chelating

O	.

O	However
O	,
O	it
O	was
O	observed
O	that
O	the

O	was
O	unaltered
O	by

B-drug	methotrexate
O	in

O	.

B-drug	Ketamine
O	:
O	When
O	administered
O	to
O	patients
O	on
O	a
B-group	thyroid
I-group	preparation
O	,
O	this
O	parenteral
B-group	anesthetic
O	may

O	.

B-drug	Acetaminophen

O	.

B-drug	Metformin
O	:
O	In
O	healthy

O	given
O	single
O	500
O	mg
O	doses

O	,
O	respectively
O	,
O	and
B-drug	metformin
O	mean
O	renal

O	%
O	.

O	Therefore
O	,
O	a
O	possible
O	lack
O	of

O	should
O	be
O	taken
O	into

O	.

O	Nevertheless
O	,
O	clinical
O	studies
O	,
O	as
O	well
O	as
O	postmarketing
O	observations
O	have
O	shown
O	that
B-brand	Lodine

O	and
O	such

O	(
O	Effects
O	may
O	be

O	The

O	Concurrent

O	significantly
O	reduces
O	the

O	,
O	but
O	it
O	is
O	unclear
O	how
O	soon

B-drug	didanosine
O	administration
B-drug	indinavir

O	.

O	When
O	such

O	to
O	a

O	,
O	the

O	.

B-drug	Phenytoin
O	,

O	with

O	Tablets
O	Simultaneous

O	.

O	Coadministration

O	No

O	This

O	increase
O	in

O	Therefore
O	,
O	such

O	.

O	In

O	,
B-group	antiparkinson
I-group	drugs
O	,

O	Because

O	No

O	The

O	In

B-drug	Hydrocodone
O	increases

O	Therefore
O	,

O	Consequently

O	-
O	Taking

O	may

O	The

O	,
O	a

O	.

O	However
O	,
O	it
O	should
O	be

O	that
O	both

O	Concomitant
O	administration

O	to
O	avoid
O	possible

O	.

O	However
O	,
O	caution
O	must
O	be
O	exercised
O	in
O	extrapolating
O	these

O	to
O	the
O	clinical
O	situation
O	and
O	in
O	the

O	.

O	The
O	daily
O	dose
O	of
B-drug	dexamethasone
O	administered
O	in

O	reflects
O	an
O	approximate
O	50
O	%
O	reduction
O	of
O	the
O	dose
O	of
B-drug	dexamethasone
O	.

O	During
O	controlled
O	hypotensive
O	anesthesia
O	using
B-drug	labetalol
I-drug	HCl
O	in

O	with
B-drug	halothane
O	,
O	high
O	concentrations
O	(
O	3
O	%
O	or
O	above
O	)
O	of
B-drug	halothane
O	should
O	not
O	be
O	used
O	because
O	the
O	degree
O	of
O	hypotension
O	will
O	be
O	increased
O	and
O	because
O	of
O	the
O	possibility
O	of
O	a
O	large
O	reduction
O	in
O	cardiac
O	output
O	and
O	an
O	increase
O	in
O	central
O	venous

O	.

O	It
O	is
O	desirable
O	to
O	monitor
B-group	TCA

O	whenever
O	a

O	is
O	going
O	to
O	be

O	Therefore

O	This

O	The

O	The

O	when

O	Coadministration

B-drug	Ketoconazole

B-drug	Lithium
O	generally

O	Further

O	Patients

B-group	Thiazide

O	:
O	The

O	that
O	the

O	use
O	of
B-drug	allopurinol
O	and
B-group	thiazide
I-group	diuretics
O	may
O	contribute
O	to
O	the

O	in
O	some

O	.

O	Concurrent

I-group	drugs

O	For

O	when

B-drug	nilutamide
O	,

O	time

O	,
O	the

I-group	K
I-group	antagonists
O	should
O	be
O	reduced
O	.

B-drug	Theophylline
O	:
B-drug	Grepafloxacin
O	is
O	a
O	competitive
O	inhibitor
O	of
O	the

O	of
B-drug	theophylline
O	.

O	However
O	,
O	the

B-drug	Phenytoin/Phenobarbital
O	:
O	The
O	coadministration
O	of
B-drug	phenytoin
O	or
B-drug	phenobarbital
O	will
O	not
O	affect
O	plasma
O	concentrations
O	of
B-group	vitamin
I-group	D
O	,
O	but

O	levels
O	of
B-drug	calcitriol/ergocalcitriol
O	by

O	.

O	In

O	these
B-group	methylxanthines
O	,
O	larger

O	,
O	the

O	The

O	.

O	The

O	The

O	.

B-drug	Aripiprazole
O	dose
O	should
O	be

O	dose
O	when

O	In

B-drug	Finasteride

O	Since

O	The

O	in

O	Caution

O	in
O	using
B-drug	Duloxetine
O	in

O	slow

B-group	Diuretic
I-group	agents
O	reduce
O	the

O	Some

O	.

O	The
O	concomitant
O	administration
O	of
B-group	uricosuric
I-group	agents
O	and
B-drug	allopurinol
O	has
O	been

O	in
O	the
O	excretion
O	of

O	(

O	A

O	The

O	The

O	should
O	be
O	kept
O	in

O	in
O	the

O	although

O	It

O	use
B-drug	alcohol
O	excessively
O	.

O	It
O	is
O	likely
O	that
